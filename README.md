# GAN(Generative Adversarial Network) represents a cutting-edge approach to generative modeling within deep learning, often leveraging architectures like convolutional neural networks. The goal of generative modeling is to autonomously identify patterns in input data, enabling the model to produce new examples that feasibly resemble the original dataset.
# What is a Generative Adversarial Network?
# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful class of neural networks that are used for an unsupervised learning. GANs are made up of two neural networks, a discriminator and a generator. They use adversarial training to produce artificial data that is identical to actual data.

# The Generator attempts to fool the Discriminator, which is tasked with accurately distinguishing between produced and genuine data, by producing random noise samples.
# Realistic, high-quality samples are produced as a result of this competitive interaction, which drives both networks toward advancement.
# GANs are proving to be highly versatile artificial intelligence tools, as evidenced by their extensive use in image synthesis, style transfer, and text-to-image synthesis.
# They have also revolutionized generative modeling.
# Through adversarial training, these models engage in a competitive interplay until the generator becomes adept at creating realistic samples, fooling the discriminator approximately half the time.

# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be broken down into three parts:

# Generative: To learn a generative model, which describes how data is generated in terms of a probabilistic model.
# Adversarial: The word adversarial refers to setting one thing up against another. This means that, in the context of GANs, the generative result is compared with the actual images in the data set. A mechanism known as a discriminator is used to apply a model that attempts to distinguish between real and fake images.
# Networks: Use deep neural networks as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for training purposes.
